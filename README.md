This script accepts content on `STDIN` and a single argument of the UUID of an existing draft. It appends the content to the end of the draft specified by the UUID.

**Examples:**
Append the content "*lorem ipsum*" to a draft with UUID `B91949F4-F976-4838-AA41-3ECFD752EDC9`.

```sh
echo lorem ipsum | ./appendtodraft.sh B91949F4-F976-4838-AA41-3ECFD752EDC9
```

## Script: `opendraft.sh`
**Description:**
This script accepts a draft UUID on `STDIN`, and will open the draft with the matching UUID in drafts.

## Script: `prependtodraft.sh`

## Script: `rundraftsaction.sh`
**Description:**
This script accepts optional text content on `STDIN` and a single argument of the (unique) name of an existing draft action. It runs the specified action, and if any optional text has been specified, this will be used as content for a temporary draft to run the action against.

**Input/Output:**

| Type   | I/O    | Data                                                   |

# Additional Information

## Aliases
To make these scripts more convenient to work with, I recommend [creating aliases](https://flaviocopes.com/how-to-set-alias-shell/) in your environment.

Here are the ones I use, with my Drafts scripts being held in a `scripts` folder in my home directory.

| Alias   | Script               | Conifguration Command                          |
|:-------:|:---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `a2d`   | `appendtodraft.sh`   | `alias opd '$HOME/scripts/appendtodraft.sh'`   |
| `opd`   | `opendraft.sh`       | `alias opd '$HOME/scripts/opendraft.sh'`       |
| `p2d`   | `prependtodraft.sh`  | `alias opd '$HOME/scripts/prependtodraft.sh'`  |
| `rda`   | `rundraftsaction.sh` | `alias opd '$HOME/scripts/rundraftsaction.sh'` |
| `2d`    | `todraft.sh`         | `alias 2d '$HOME/scripts/todraft.sh'`          |
| `2df`   | `todraftflagged.sh`  | `alias 2df '$HOME/scripts/todraftflagged.sh'`  |


## Combined Use Examples
The following examples utilise the aliases above to aid clarity, and provide examples of how you can use multiple scripts together.


Create a new draft containing a list of all files (including hidden files) in the current directory and then open the draft in the app.
```
ls -a | 2d listing | opd
```
